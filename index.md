# About Us

The [Leeds Institute of Health Sciences](https://medicinehealth.leeds.ac.uk/homepage/146/leeds_institute_of_health_science)
is interested in a range of topics including primary care, psychiatric medicine, health service optimisation, geriatrics,
and health economics. We have a mix of both qualitative and quantitiative researchers and a small army of PhD students.

This seminar series is run by our research students as a venue for sharing ideas, practice talks before conferences,
and to bring all the different specialities together.

*Previous talks and slides can be found at the bottom of the page.*
